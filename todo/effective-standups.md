# Effective Standups
* this advice is for synchronous scrum standups. I have no experience with asyncronous standups so this advice may not apply here

# Tasks not Attendance
* as scrum master, your responsibility is to keep everyone engaged in the standup
* host your meeting in front of the scrum board
    * or show the scrum board in a virtual setting
* don't jump around randomly
    * create a continuous narrative to make is easy for every one to follow
    * doing a round-robin through your team members will likely cause updates to come in a random order and be unrelated
    * by ordering updates based on each topic, you increase the chances that the update that follows will be related
    * get updates on topics that are the closest to being finished first. This will help with velocity and emphasise the importance of finishing tickets
* focus on topics rather than people
    * topics can be tickets, projects, epics, etc. This depends on the scale of your standup
    * ideally the scale should be around 1 or 2 owners per topic

# Accountability
* topics should have an owner. this is the default person to give an update, but others may join in if they're helping (e.g. code review, pair programming)
* identify cases where help is needed and asks for volunteers (assign them if nobody does)
* assign work naturally. If someone worked on a related task, or has expressed interest in the topic, they should be your first choice for completing the task

# Defer Deeper Conversations
* standups should be short (< 15 mins)
* keep each update focused on current state, and any roadblocks
* participants should have enough information to know if they can help
* more detailed conversations should happen after all updates have been given. make sure that these post-standup conversations actually happen and dismiss people who are not involved
* keeping updates to the point allows others participants to pay attention. announcing roadblocks gives others the opportunity to offer help or suggest a solution to your roadblock
* identify situations where the team needs to really dive in to an issue. Use the scrum time to announce any impromptu meetings

# Pigs and Chickens
* this metaphor has been removed from the scrum guide but can still be helpful
* there are people who are actively involved in the day-to-day work (pigs)
* and those who are incidental to that work (chickens)
* this will depend on the structure of your team, but will likely relate to the time scale of everyone's work. Design and Product will usually work on a project before Developers do, so in a Developer-focused standup, Design and Product are the chickens. they don't need to give an update but will usually benefit from the pigs' updates and can usually jump in to help solve any questions about what's to be built. This can come naturally from a topic-oriented standup

# Timing
* there's nothing in the scrum guide that tells you to have your standup first-thing in the morning, yet so many teams do this.  What is important is that the scrum takes place at the same time and location every day. This predictability allows your team members to effectively plan their day around the daily scrum and helps with the problem of "too many meetings".
* I think some managers hold their scrum at the start of the work day to force team members to show up to work "on time," whatever that means. By using the timing of the scrum to enforce a policy, you run the risk of compromising the quality of your scrum. If half your team is not mentally present for scrum, this ceremony will be ineffective.
* holding scrum near the middle of the day gives everyone time to prepare for scrum as well as giving time for people to react to scrum as well. You have enough time to call a longer meeting related to the scrum in the same day
